                    <p>
                        Paul Knorr, born in 1882, studied violinmaking with Dolling. 
                        Working in Berlin and Breslau, he established himself in the
                        Markneukirchen workshop of F & R Enders in 1918. 
                        Starting in 1921, Knorr became and independent maker. 
                        Attaining mastery of his craft, Knorr was highly respected 
                        for wood and material selection. He was also adept at 
                        following the patterns, approach, and varnishing 
                        techniques of the Cremonese masters.
